          <p class="p-about">
            I'm an architectural photographer turned software developer with a
            focus on the Front End. I'm passionate about collaborating with
            others to create solutions that exceed the dreams of clients. I
            truly believe that empathy for the user is the key to good design.
            <br />
            <br />
            I met my wife in Guatemala. I've traveled the Trans-Siberian Railway
            and the Silk Road. I enjoy hiking, photography, and going on
            adventures with my daughter.

            <p class="p-bloom p-project">
              The idea for Bloom Trek was born out of a desire to locate hiking
              trails around Denver that have flowers that are currently
              blooming. Bloom Trek displays parks near the user's current
              location and the corresponding blooming flowers/plants in that
              area for the current (or chosen) month. Trails within a 10-mile
              radius of the park are displayed as well. The focus of this
              project was to be able to effectively collaborate and communicate
              between all members of our group while trying new technologies.
              Using an agile process to turn well-defined requirements into
              deployed and production ready software.

              Photo Buyer allows users to upload, purchase, and edit photos. It
              also allows users to sign in and create an account that saves
              their information to a Prisma database and hosts images on
              Cloudinary. Photo Buyer was built with React using Apollo Client
              to fetch data with GraphQL and perform mutations while using a
              GraphQl Yoga server. Buyers can make secure purchases through
              Stripe and save their orders to the database. Photo Buyer is
              tested with Jest using the assertion library Enzyme. Check it out
